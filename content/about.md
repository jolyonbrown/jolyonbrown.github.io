.plan is my blog, named for the old Unix file that people used for their status updates.

Mainly planning on using it to jot down notes about the various projects I've got on the go (at the moment most of these involve AI/ML). This is my workshop in public. There'll be project notes, interesting finds, and whatever else seems worth sharing. No guarantees on consistency of topic.
