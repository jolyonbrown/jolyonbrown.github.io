            <h2>Codenames</h2>
<h3>3rd January 2025</h3>
<p>After a relatively busy Thursday, today felt like an encore of the post Xmas period. Barely an email or Slack message crossed my screen. Took advantage and lined a bunch of work up to get done this weekend. </p>
<p>(Decided I will after all lift wholesale Warren Ellis’ use of project codenames for things that are not yet public. He’ll likely never read this but I’m unashamedly copying him here)</p>
<p>PROJECT DAPHNE is an ongoing development. A ground up rewrite of in house software previously used by a defunct client. Big milestone for that next week. I didn’t choose the name for this one! Very hopeful for it though. </p>
<p>PROJECT MERCENARY will probably be the other one on deck this weekend. Bit early for that one. Close behind are SENTINEL, PAPERBOY and I think FEDERATION. But these might only get a little fleshing out for the moment.</p>
<p>Plus some tinkering with this ‘engine’ that isn’t. The workflow is a little clunky at the moment.</p>
<p>On the subject of which I need to spend a bit of time sorting out how I want to integrate LLMs into my work a little bit more easily. Not sure which is the best solution for NeoVim (which I want to stick with if I can) at the moment. I want to have proper code completion and function writing at least.</p>
<p>Day 3 of Dry January. Easy going so far. The bathroom scales are encouraging in their immediate downward plunge after only a few days. Although this should be equal parts horrific in that there was clearly a surplus of calories just sloshing about waiting to be expunged.</p>
<h3>Todays Links / Reading</h3>

<p>Interesting explanation of how the SRE function at Google has embraced systems theory and control theory to improve resilience</p>
