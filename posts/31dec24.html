            <h2>Out with the old, in with the new..</h2>
<h3>31st December 2024</h3>
<p>Not having touched this old site for <em>four and a half years</em>, during which so much has happened (not all of it good, putting it mildly) I thought I'd trash the whole thing and start afresh.</p>
<p>Of course, this meant looking at what static blog generation tools there were and themes and nothing was quite fitting the bill of being simple but with the potential of doing more.. before I knew it I was writing something from scratch. So here we are. Version 0.01-pre-alpha of whatever this turns into. Static for the moment, generated from markdown.</p>
<p>I've vague notions of this evolving over time into something much grander, while fulfilling my need for daily status and bookmarks of things I'm thinking about along with longer posts as they reach maturity. We'll see I guess.</p>
