            <h2>Zibaldone</h2>
<h3>1st January 2025</h3>
<p>A day for pottering about enjoying the relative quiet. Bit of tinkering with the code that generates this blog. Coming up with plans and goals for the year.</p>
<p>Busy month coming up. Not quite sure how I'll talk about stuff yet. I quite like how Warren Ellis refers to projects by codewords in his newsletter <a href="https://orbitaloperations.beehiiv.com/">Orbital Operations</a>, so I might borrow that.</p>
<p>While I was looking for the explanation he gave for why he does that, I came across him mentioning the word <em>Zibaldone</em> which I hadn't heard before. Kind of sums up what I want here I guess. </p>
