I'm not quite there - yet - but I am at the point where I want to build my own peripherals - starting with a trackball.\n\nI've always liked them as an element of an interface. I think it harks back to those early 80s halcyon arcade days and playing Missile Command, Crystal Castles and Marble Madness. I liked the pinpoint accuracy you could get - or as pinpoint as a bit of hardware that was battered daily by hordes of kids could get. This was years before I ever even saw a mouse, let alone used one.\n\nFor a few years now I've been using the Logitech MX Ergo and it's a fine bit of kit. I do get odd looks though from people when I pull it out of my bag for use in an office. The trackball is set to the side rather than on the top so it's operated with your thumb. It tilts up on a metal plate base which is held on by a magnet for a more comfortable holding position. But for a while I've noticed that after some heavy use of it my thumb joint starts 'locking' and it takes a bit of effort and a noticeable click to free it.
