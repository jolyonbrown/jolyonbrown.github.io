          <p>2018 has started off pretty well as far as time management goes. I&rsquo;ve started to actually make some progress on some stalled projects which I&rsquo;ll talk about in the next few posts. Its amazing the amount of time ditching idle browsing and keeping up with Twitter frees up.</p>

<p>Thanks to being born in the early seventies, my middle childhood and teenage years coincided with the eighties British computer revolution. I can’t emphasise enough the impact of this on me at the time. I lived and breathed these new machines. To cut a long story short, I ended up with a Commodore 64 and was completely obsessed with knowing everything about it. I owe my entire career to that time and to that machine in particular.</p>

<p>Fast forward 30-odd years (insert horrified emoji here) and I’m delighted that retro computing is undergoing somewhat of a renaissance, with the C64 in particular seeing a bunch of new games and demos being written for it. Some of the stuff getting posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/c64/">/r/c64</a> subreddit these days is quite amazing. New fanzines like <a href="https://freeze64.com/">Freeze64</a> and the showcase of games on <a href="https://itch.io/search?q=c64">Itch.io</a> show how much love there still is out there for the good old breadbin.</p>

<p>So a while back I pondered starting a project to contribute to this reawakened scene, without being quite sure what to do. Having seen just about every demo with a scroll text back in the day I didn’t think the world needed any more of those. There wasn&rsquo;t a huge amount of spare time to create a game from scratch. What about, I wondered, doing a conversion? That would mean not having to figure out gameplay, and perhaps graphics and sound might be easier too. What game did the C64 miss out on, back then?</p>

<p>By coincidence I happened across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/5r4f2c/two_years_of_roguelike_development_faqs/">list</a> of ‘rogue like’ game development FAQs on Reddit which reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">Nethack</a>, the classic old text based game. I could port that. Perfect. The C64 was known for it’s PETSCII character set, so that hopefully bodes well. I don’t even remember it having any sound.. plus the code is open source!</p>

<p>Surely, I thought, this must have been done already? A good search around suggested it hadn’t (although there were some similar old games). I&rsquo;m not underestimating the difficulty here though - the least powerful system I ever personally saw Nethack running on was an Amiga back in the day, which had way more resources than the C64 ever had.</p>

<p>So yes, I’m porting an old game to an old platform for the love and challenge of it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to set myself some limitations: I’m not expecting this done be done in a hurry. Likely I&rsquo;ll only have a few hours a month to work on this. There’s no rush. No deadlines. I do want it to run on a stock C64 with disk drive if possible, so at least a few hours will be spent reviving my old setup, which is languishing in the garage at the moment.</p>
