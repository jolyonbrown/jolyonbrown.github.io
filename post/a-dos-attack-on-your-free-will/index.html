            <p>My sabbatical from social media (well, Twitter) has commenced but, as luck would have it, during my last few visits I actually found some interesting/useful information. The kind of thing I originally used the service for. This gave me pause for thought, but then I read an article on <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will">Nautil.us</a> which made my mind up. That&rsquo;s definitely it now. There is obviously a certain danger of confirmation bias here on my part given that I was thinking along these lines anyway, but quotes and links to studies showing that &ldquo;repeated distractions lower people’s effective IQ by up to 10 points&rdquo; makes it easy to cement my decision.</p>

<p>If/when I do return it&rsquo;ll have to be in a much reduced capacity. Probably a ground zero approach on people I follow, better use of lists and more automation. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do a blog post on how I set it up. I think <a href="http://morning.computer/2017/10/box-of-autumn">Warren Ellis</a> does something similar and is <em>hugely</em> productive, so that&rsquo;s something to aim for perhaps.</p>

<p>It might be my imagination, but I already I think I&rsquo;m seeing a benefit from simply having more time to do things. Those &ldquo;few&rdquo; minutes distractedly scrolling through a Twitter feed certainly do add up. I&rsquo;m disabling as many notifications as I can get away with too. I must have been crazy to allow Apple News to send notifications to my phone screen (with accompanying buzz). Why should I allow a media company to interrupt whatever I&rsquo;m doing, just so they can get some advertising revenue?</p>
