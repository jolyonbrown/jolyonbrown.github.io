<p>My name is Jolyon Brown, I'm a Dad, Husband etc. Sadly lost my son Oliver to Mitochondrial Disease in 2023 at the age of 19.</p>
<p>I guess my core career has been as a Unix/linux admin, despite the many name changes this has had over the years.</p>
<p>Interested in too many things to actually make much headway in anything. Hopefully I can change this and you can follow my journey on this site.</p>
