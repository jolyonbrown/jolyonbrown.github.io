      <title>A DoS attack on your free will</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My sabbatical from social media (well, Twitter) has commenced but, as luck would have it, during my last few visits I actually found some interesting/useful information. The kind of thing I originally used the service for. This gave me pause for though, but then I read the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which made my mind up. That&amp;rsquo;s definitely it now. There is obviously a certain danger of confirmation bias here on my part given that I was thinking along these lines anyway, but quotes and links to studies showing that &amp;ldquo;repeated distractions lower people’s effective IQ by up to 10 points&amp;rdquo; makes it easy to cement my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If/when I do return it&amp;rsquo;ll have to be in a much reduced capacity. Probably a ground zero approach on people I follow, better use of lists and more automation. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do a blog post on how I set it up. I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://morning.computer/2017/10/box-of-autumn/&#34;&gt;Warren Ellis&lt;/a&gt; does something similar and is &lt;i&gt;hugely&lt;/a&gt; productive, so that&amp;rsquo;s something to aim for perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be my imagination, but I already I think I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a benefit from simply having more time to do things. Those &amp;ldquo;few&amp;rdquo; minutes distractedly scrolling through a Twitter feed certainly do add up. I&amp;rsquo;m disabling as many notifications as I can get away with too. I must have been crazy to allow Apple News to send notifications to my phone screen (with accompanying buzz). Why should I allow a media company to interrupt whatever I&amp;rsquo;m doing, just so they can get some advertising revenue?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A social media sabbatical</title>
      <link>https://jolyonbrown.com/post/a-social-media-sabbatical/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;rsquo;ve really struggled with in the last few years is starting projects and never getting them finished. I&amp;rsquo;ve items on my personal development to do list which have been there for longer than I can remember. Courses (paid for, in some cases) sit half completed. Websites and apps gather dust in version controlled repos, never destined to see the light of day. This blog is a prime example. I avoid looking at the dozens of draft, never to be published posts that litter my source directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now recognise that this is partly down to wasting the free time that I do have on activities that are ultimately worthless. For example, I find it shockingly easy to sink time into Twitter that could be spent doing something else. Worse still, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to get the creeping feeling that catching up with my Twitter feeds - time which I once thought of as being a useful investment, keeping up to date with both the state of the world and developments in my professional sphere - is detrimental to my (or anyone elses for that matter) cognitive health. I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to think of the pieces of information inhaled from Twitter on a daily basis as being a bit like the calories you get from alcohol. Ingesting them is pleasurable at the time, but ultimately they&amp;rsquo;re worthless in terms of nutrition and probably bad for you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was very interested by one of the best audiobooks I&amp;rsquo;ve bought in the last twelve months: Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Deep Work - Rules for focused success in a distracted world&lt;/i&gt;. In it, Newport describes &amp;ldquo;Deep Work&amp;rdquo; as being the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. This is the kind of state I want to achieve in order to start completing some of the work I want to do. One of his recommendations for getting there is to quit or switch to the controlled use of social media. A bit like giving up beer and wine for a month (which I&amp;rsquo;ve started to do each January), I think the potential benefits make it worth trying; so I&amp;rsquo;m going cold turkey on Twitter until sometime in 2018, after which I&amp;rsquo;ll only use it in a controlled manner. The worst that can happen is I still don&amp;rsquo;t get this work done, but I miss out on some anger and stress around the state of UK politics/Brexit and Trump. Stuff I have no influence over anyway. I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Awk: Set Output Filename Variable via Field Contents</title>
      <link>https://jolyonbrown.com/post/awk-set-filename-variable-by-field-contents/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I suspect the title of this post would win a prize for the worst on the internet. Oh well. On a new contract at the moment working with people from various backgrounds in IT. One of my new co-workers had a text file containing a dump of a postgres database and wanted to extract all the CREATE FUNCTION statements out of it for analysis; could I take a look as resident Linux guy? There was a lot of other stuff in the file, the functions were of varying length and split over a number of lines and had a couple of differing closing parameters. Awk was obviously the go-to tool here, but the request had the added complication that each function had to be stored in a seperate output file, named after the function that was being extracted into it. While matching between two patterns is easy in awk, I had some struggle finding out how to dump lines into a file whose name was set by a variable which was in turn set by the contents of a field. Google failed me so I’ve posted this in the hope it helps some other poor soul and saves them the syntax errors I endured figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CREATE FUNCTION statement looked like this in the file in question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE FUNCTION function_name(variable name type) RETURNS
another_variable
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
    DECLARE
    ...
    &amp;lt;Various SQL statements&amp;gt;
    ...
END;
$$;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $$; sequence was replaced by $_$ in other functions for some reason (personal preference of whoever wrote it I guess). The desired name for the output file would be ‘function_name’ in this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the (one liner of course) awk statement I ended up using (you may need to scroll to see the whole thing):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;awk -F&#39; |[(]&#39; &#39;/CREATE FUNCTION/ {p=1;name=$3}; p {print &amp;gt; name}; /\$\$;|\$_\$;/ {p=0;close(name)}; &#39; INPUT.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation. The parameters to the -F set the awk field delimiter to either (thanks to the | symbol) a space ’ ’ or open bracket &lt;a href=&#34;the square brackets being used to escape the regular one&#34;&gt;(&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The /CREATE FUNCTION/ is the first pattern to match against. When awk sees that, it sets variable p to 1, and sets the variable name to field 3 of that line, which in our case is the name of the function up to the (.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The p {print &amp;gt; name}; statement prints out lines if p equals 1 (the default action for awk). It also dumps any printed lines into a file, using the name variable as the filename. The position of the ‘p’ in the middle of this statement means that the whole desired range is printed, including the two patterns being matched against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (escaped) $$; sequence is an end pattern to match on, as is the alternative (signified by the | ) $_$; (also escaped). Once either of these is seen, awk sets p to zero, and closes the file. Failing to close the file results in an error relating to too many files being open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The INPUT.sql is merely the file awk reads from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result – a long manual edit avoided and many small files, correctly named and containing the correct statements. Good old awk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update (2017). I&amp;rsquo;ve moved this page from my old blog (the only surviving post!) as it occasionally gets hits for very obscure awk related searches. Hopefully has helped someone out in the last few years..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
